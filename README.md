### Available Official Plugins

| Plugin Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Auto Clicker** | A foundational plugin that provides customizable, automated mouse clicking functionality. |
| **Key Presser** | A utility designed to **rapidly and repeatedly press a single key** that you've configured it for. |
| **Tea Time** | A simple but essential utility that sends you a reminder to drink tea (or take a break!) every 3600 seconds. |
| **Hotkey Password** | Integrates with your system's keyring to securely type passwords into a password manager, prioritizing **safety first**. **It does not copy the password to your clipboard**; it securely retrieves it from your keyring and directly types it into the active password field. **Highly recommended for users of password managers.** |

### Important Information for Users and Developers

Please be aware that these plugins are primarily designed for **developers and users who are comfortable working in the terminal**. They often require a basic understanding of scripting and package management. You should be prepared to:

  * **Download and install any necessary packages manually.**
  * **Execute commands directly in your terminal.**

**To download plugins, please navigate to the Releases tab of the respective platform (GitHub, GitLab, CodeBerg, etc.) and download the `.zip` files from the assets section of the latest release.**

**Setup scripts are generally not provided**, and if they are, consider it a bonus! While some plugins may include a `README.md` file with instructions, others might not. This repository is for those who enjoy a hands-on approach and want to extend Hotkey Engineer's capabilities with powerful, community-vetted tools.
