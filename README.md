### Important Information for Users and Developers

Please be aware that these plugins are primarily designed for **developers and users who are comfortable working in the terminal**. They often require a basic understanding of scripting and package management. You should be prepared to:

  * **Download and install any necessary packages manually.**
  * **Execute commands directly in your terminal.**

**To download plugins, please navigate to the GitHub Releases page and download the `.zip` files from the assets section of the latest release.**

**Setup scripts are generally not provided**, and if they are, consider it a bonus\! While some plugins may include a `README.md` file with instructions, others might not. This repository is for those who enjoy a hands-on approach and want to extend Hotkey Engineer's capabilities with powerful, community-vetted tools.
